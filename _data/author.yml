    Hi there!
    </p>
  <br>
    <p>
    I am Jonas, research scientist at Web3 Foundation, and the person behind G-dot Tech. Currently, I am providing consulting- and staking services in the blockchain space. My specialities are within the Kusama, Polkadot as well as on the Khala network.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> A little bit about myself: I obtained a Ph.D. in behavioral economics and am interested in how users interact with blockchain protocols. One of my current research topics has the goal to offer a user-friendly process for nominators to make informed votes on their validators. I also love to dig into data and make statistical analyses, for example, about on-chain user behavior and general economic metrics of the network.
